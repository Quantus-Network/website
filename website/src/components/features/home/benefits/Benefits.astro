      The Future is Quantum
    </h2>

    <p class="font-body-mobile text-center">
      Quantus Network is a Layer 1 blockchain designed to thrive in the quantum
      era. Secured with post-quantum cryptography and scaled with zero-knowledge
      proofs, it delivers a level of security, scalability and usability that
      today's chains can't match. A clean-slate design that anticipates the
      coming wave of quantum technology.
