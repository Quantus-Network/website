# Community Governance

Quantus is not owned by a corporation; it is owned by the community. Our governance model ensures that every QUAN holder has a say.

## How it Works

1. **Proposals**: Any community member can submit a proposal.
2. **Discussion**: Proposals are debated in our open forums.
3. **Voting**: Holders use their QUAN tokens to vote on key decisions, from protocol upgrades to treasury allocations.

We believe that decentralization is only possible when the community is in the driver's seat.
