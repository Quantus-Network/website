# How to Secure Your Seed Phrase

Your seed phrase is the key to your entire digital wealth. In a decentralized world, there is no "forgot password" button.

## Best Practices

1. **Never Digital**: Never store your seed phrase on a computer, phone, or cloud storage.
2. **Physical Backup**: Write it on paper or stamp it into metal.
3. **Split it Up**: Store different parts of the phrase in separate, secure locations.
4. **Guardians**: Use the Quantus "Guardians" feature to add a layer of social recovery.

Remember: Not your keys, not your coins.
