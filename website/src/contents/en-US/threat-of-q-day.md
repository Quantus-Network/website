# The Threat of Q-Day

"Q-Day" refers to the day when quantum computers become powerful enough to break Shor’s algorithm, rendering modern encryption useless.

## The Risk to Bitcoin and Ethereum

Most existing blockchains use Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECDSA). A quantum computer could derive a private key from a public key in minutes, allowing them to drain any "exposed" address.

## How Quantus Protects You

Quantus was built from the ground up with **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)**. We use lattice-based algorithms that even the most powerful quantum computers cannot crack.

Don't wait until it's too late. Prepare for the quantum era today.
