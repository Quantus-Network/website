# ZK-Proofs Explained

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-Proofs) are a breakthrough in cryptography that allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself.

## How Quantus Uses ZK-Proofs

In the Quantus Network, we use recursive ZK-SNARKs to compress the entire history of the blockchain into a tiny proof.

### Benefits:
- **Massive Scalability**: Nodes don't need to re-run every transaction.
- **Privacy**: Transactions can be verified without exposing sensitive data.
- **Lightweight Nodes**: Run a node on your smartphone!

Stay tuned for our technical deep dive into our recursive SNARK architecture.
