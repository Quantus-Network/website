# Tokenomics of QUAN

The QUAN token is the lifeblood of the Quantus Network. It was designed to ensure long-term sustainability and fair distribution.

## Key Stats

- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 QUAN.
- **Utility**: Used for gas fees, staking, and governance.
- **Deflationary Mechanism**: A portion of every transaction fee is burned.

## Distribution

We have allocated 50% of the total supply for mining rewards over the next 20 years to ensure that the network remains decentralized for generations to come.
