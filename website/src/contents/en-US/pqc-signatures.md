# Post-Quantum Signatures

At the heart of Quantus's security lies our signature scheme. After extensive research, we adopted **Dilithium**.

## Why Dilithium?

Dilithium is part of the CRYSTALS (Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices) package and was selected by NIST for its balance of:
- **Security**: Hard mathematical problems (Short Integer Solution).
- **Efficiency**: Small signature sizes compared to other PQC schemes.
- **Performance**: Fast verification times.

By using Dilithium, Quantus ensures that your identity and transactions remain authentic even in a world filled with quantum computers.
