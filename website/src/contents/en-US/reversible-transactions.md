# Reversible Transactions

One of the biggest hurdles to crypto adoption is the fear of losing funds due to a single mistake. Quantus solves this with **Reversible Transactions**.

## How It Works

When you send a transaction, you can define a "reversibility window" (e.g., 24 hours). During this time, if you realize you made a mistake or fell for a scam, you can initiate a reversal.

### Use Cases:
1. **Mistyped Addresses**: Get your funds back instantly.
2. **Merchant Disputes**: A built-in escrow-like feature.
3. **Scam Protection**: Intercept fraudulent transfers before they finalize.

This is self-custody with a safety net.
