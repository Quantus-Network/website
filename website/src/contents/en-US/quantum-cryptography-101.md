# Quantum Cryptography 101

As quantum computers continue to evolve, the cryptographic foundations of the internet face unprecedented challenges. Most of today's encryption methods, including RSA and ECC, rely on mathematical problems that are difficult for classical computers but trivial for sufficiently powerful quantum computers.

## Why it Matters

If a quantum computer can break current encryption, every digital asset—from bank accounts to private messages—becomes vulnerable.

## The Solution: Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)

Quantus Network utilizes **Post-Quantum Cryptography**. These are cryptographic algorithms that are thought to be secure against attacks from both quantum and classical computers.

### Key Algorithms we use:
- **Dilithium**: For digital signatures.
- **Kyber**: For key encapsulation.

Stay tuned as we dive deeper into each of these technologies in future posts.
