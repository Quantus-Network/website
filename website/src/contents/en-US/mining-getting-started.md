# Mining on Quantus

Quantus uses a hybrid consensus mechanism that allows anyone with a standard computer to participate in securing the network.

## Requirements

- **CPU/GPU**: Most modern hardware is capable.
- **Quantus Node**: Download the latest software from our GitHub.
- **Stability**: A consistent internet connection.

## Why Mine?

By mining, you help decentralize the network and protect it from attacks. In return, you earn block rewards in the form of QUAN tokens.

Join the revolution and start securing the quantum future today.
