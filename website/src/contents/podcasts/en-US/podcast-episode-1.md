In this debut episode it's just us — Christopher Smith and Joe Mattia — kicking things off with raw thoughts, real talk, and a few unfiltered tangents you definitely didn't ask for… but might just love.

We dive into Chris's early life, his obsession with math and music, how he shifted from piano to topology, how he stumbled into tech by walking into the wrong office, and how discovering Bitcoin changed the entire trajectory of his career.

This episode sets the tone for everything to come: curiosity, clarity, and conversations that push the boundaries of culture, technology, and human freedom.
