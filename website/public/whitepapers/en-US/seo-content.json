Introduction The Quantum Threat Traditional blockchains face an existential threat from the advent of quantum computing. The cryptographic foundations of blockchains rely on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem (DLP), and quantum algorithms, notably Shor’s, can solve the DLP exponentially faster than classical computers. This vulnerability could enable quantum-adversaries to derive private keys from public keys, which would allow them to forge transactions and decrypt sensitive financial data. The outcome is a catastrophic system failure. Without proactive quantum-resistant upgrades, the trillion-dollar crypto economy risks sudden devaluation from such attacks. Quantus fixes thi"}
